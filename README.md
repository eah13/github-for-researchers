github for researchers
======================

GitHub is a great tool for researchers. Here's why.

what it is
-----
GitHub is a web-based tool that helps you keep track of revisions in your files.

It's not just for code. GitHub can version just about any **type** of file - including LaTeX, [CSV's](https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs) and [3D graphics](https://github.com/blog/1633-3d-file-diffs). So you can use it for writing and researching as well as developing software.

There is a desktop client for [Mac](http://mac.github.com) or [Windows](http://windows.github.com) that you can use to manage your files.

You can also just do everything from your web browser (including [zen writing mode](https://github.com/blog/1379-zen-writing-mode) which is pretty damn cool).

who it's for
-----
It's for people who...
- create files
- that change
- (sometimes) working with other people
- (sometimes) to share with other people

not to mention
-----
There are project management features built in:
 - set milestones with due dates
 - create issues (you can use this to create a [research to-do list](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/12/06/github-issues-tracker:-the-perfect-research-todo-list))
 - assign issues to people
 - track your progress by connecting an issue's resolution to a file revision

public vs. private
-----
[Repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo) ("repos") are collections of files. Any public repositories are free.

Private repos are cheap.

There are discounts, including [free private repos for educational users](https://github.com/edu).
